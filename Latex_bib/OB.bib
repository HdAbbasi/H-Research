                  about sparse sets: (1) With respect to what types of
                  reductions might NP have hard or complete sparse
                  sets? (2) If a set A reduces to a sparse set, does
                  it follow that A is reducible to some sparse set
                  that is ``simple'' relative to A? (3) With respect
                  to what types of reductions might NP have hard or
                  complete sets of low instance complexity, and,
                  relatedly, what is the structure of the class of
                  sets with low instance complexity? With respect to
                  the first and third questions, intuitively one would
                  expect that even with respect to flexible reductions
                  NP is unlikely to have complete sets whose
                  information content is low. With respect to the
                  second question, one might intuitively feel that the
                  structure imposed on a set by the fact that it
                  reduces to a sparse set makes it plausible that we
                  can indeed find a simple sparse set that can
                  masquerade as the original sparse set. These two
                  intuitions are in many ways certified by the current
                  literature, and by the results of this paper."

We then pursue problems that are complete for these classes via subtractive reductions. We focus on the class \#NP (which is the same as the class \#.coNP) and show that it contains natural complete problems via subtractive reductions, such as the problem of counting the minimal models of a Boolean formula in conjunctive normal form and the problem of counting the cardinality of the set of minimal solutions of a homogeneous system of linear Diophantine inequalities.},

@article{DeNivelleEA00,
	Abstract = {In this paper we give an overview of resolution methods for extended
propositional modal logics.
We adopt the standard translation approach and consider different
resolution refinements which provide decision procedures for the
resulting clause sets.
Our procedures are based on ordered resolution and selection-based
resolution.
The logics that we cover are multi-modal logics defined over relations
closed under intersection, union, converse and possibly
complementation.
